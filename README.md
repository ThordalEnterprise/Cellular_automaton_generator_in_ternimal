- In cellular automata, a rule is a set of instructions that determine how the state of a cell in the grid will change based on the state of its neighboring cells. The "rule value" is a number that represents the specific set of instructions for a particular cellular automaton.

- The Initcond phrase, also known as the initial condition phrase, refers to the initial state of the cells in a cellular automaton. This phrase typically defines the starting configuration of the cells, which can be set randomly or according to a specific pattern. The initial condition is used as the starting point for the automaton's evolution, and can have a significant impact on the final outcome of the simulation.

- In cellular automata, the impulse position refers to the specific location or cell in the initial configuration of the automaton where a change or "impulse" is applied. This impulse is typically used to initiate the evolution of the automaton and can take the form of a change in the state of a single cell or a group of cells. The impulse position can also be thought of as the seed for the automaton's evolution. In some cases, the impulse position may be a randomly chosen cell or a user-specified location.

- The color Map in cellular automata refers to the way in which the different states of the cells are represented visually. Typically, each state is assigned a unique color, and the cells are colored according to their current state. The color Map can be chosen based on the specific application or desired visual representation. It can be set to any color Map. The color Map is used to visualize the pattern of states of the cells in the grid over time.
